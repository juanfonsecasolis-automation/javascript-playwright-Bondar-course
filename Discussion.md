# Is Javascript a suitable language for automation?

Copyright 2024-2025 Juan M. Fonseca-Sol√≠s.

## Problem
The use of automation frameworks based on Javascript (JS) and Typescript (TS) is becoming more and more popular, which is in partly due to the popularity of JS/Node.js in web development and the bias of authors to write the automation in the same language than the system under test.

## Objective
Determine if JS/TS/Playwright is a suitable tool-language combination for automating tests.

## State of the art
According to Zhan, maintainability is the key aspect when determining if an end-to-end automation framework is suitable for testing. Below is the criteria he provides for knowing if a combination of programming language, test tool, and test framework is a good choice [2]:

* i. **Scripting (interpreted) language.** Scripting languages provide a high-level syntax that lets to achieve more functionality with fewer lines of code (fewer lines of code facilitates maintainability and readability) [3, 9]. Besides, test automation is enterprise software, which means that it doesn't have to be implemented in the same language as the main application [2, 8].
* ii. **Easy-to-understand syntax.** Some languages make excessive and unnecessary use of code nesting, parentheses (brackets, rounded, square), lambda expressions, and synchronization keywords which makes reading and writing code difficult. Automation should be easy to write also by team members with low code skills, so they can help to the team productivity [2].
* iii. **Object-oriented programming language (OOPL).** OOPL is required to implement the Page Object Model (POM), a design pattern that facilitates the automation maintainability by separating the logic from of the tests from the logic to iteract with the web page [2].
* iv. **Language is officially supported by the test tool.** Languages that are not officially supported by the framework will require hacks to work properly, writting hacks is a time consuming task [2].

According to Zhan, Javascript (JS) satisfies conditions i and iv, but not ii and iii, and he mentions that Python and Ruby are better choices. Besides, TypeScript (TS), is a super set of Javascript and violates i and iii (TS is a compiled language and still doesn't fully implement OOPL) [4, 5, 6, 7].

## Method
With the help of Artem Bondar's course (the highest rated Playwright course on Udemy as of August 2025) we created a minimal working example (MWE) on JS/TS/Playwright, then we analyzed if Zhan's criteria makes JS/TS/Playwright a good or bad combination [1]. The solution can be found at [https://github.com/juanfonsecasolis-automation/javascript-playwright-Bondar-course](https://github.com/juanfonsecasolis-automation/javascript-playwright-Bondar-course).

## Findings

### About Playwright...
The syntax is indeed different than Selenium, especially when combined with JS/TS . Overall, this framework is fast and makes automation easy by providing an extra layer of abstraction to interact with web components. Here are some examples:
* it provides methods to check/uncheck checkboxes, so testers don't need to know in advance the previous status of the component,
* it provides ways to find elements and apply assertions in one step, instead of having to initialize the objects and then look for their properties,
* it let find elements by role using the "GetByRole" method (for instance, button or label) instead of having to realy solely in XPath or CSS locators,
* it let navigate backwards in locators paths using ".." instead of using "ancestor".

One disadvantage is that creating test fixtures is tricky.

### Abouts JS/TS...
Using JS/TS wasn't that bad, for non-web developers though these languages have a steeper learning curve compared with C#, Java, or Python. Also, there are some annoyances in the syntax:
1. programmers need to type the keyword "await" all the times that they want to access a web component (it's tricky to know where to put them and maybe this is Playwright specific),
2. the use of async and the parenthesis nesting "({})" (sending an empty dictionary of parameters) adds unnecesary overhead,
3. programmers have to export functions to make them visible in outside modules,
4. "ES modules" is an obscure topic,
5. programmers have to use the `export` keyword to use functions outside a file.

Some points in favor are:
1. as in other languages, you still have accesibility modifiers,
1. programmers can call ReactJS test libraries natively,
1. programmers can define aliases for long commands in the package.json file,
1. programmers can use the describe-test syntax (preferred over Gherkin, when implementing BDD). 

Regarding Zhan's criteria; yes, JS/TS still doesn't have an easy-to-understand syntax compared with Python/Ruby (point ii); and no, in practice we didn't notice that TS wasn't a fully Object-oriented programming language (point iv) when doing inheritance, abstraction, or polymorphis (from a day-to-day practical perspective).

## Conclusions
If your client wants to use Playwright with JS/TS for automation, great! go for it, we didn't notice the limitations of TS as a not-fully object-oriented programming language and Playwright seems a good alternative to Selenium when interacting with web-components and doing assertions. However, you might want to explain that JS/TS has a complex syntax that will require to allocate specialized resources in automation (likely to happen in large teams). For small teams, where resources need to jump from one role into another, our recommendation is to use Playwright/Selenium with a language like Python.
